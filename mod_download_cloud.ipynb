        "2. A folder in your Google Drive containing<br>\n",
        "  a) RunTable file<br>This file should contain the list of RunIDs that you want to download from ENA ([example]())<br>\n",

        "1. If you noticed that the file has not been downloaded successfully (\"Download speed/time not accepted\"), not to worry, the script will attempt to download it again.\n",
        "2. Download got interrupted due to runtime disconnecting? Just re-run the script with 'Option B' (Step 1.2, part 5) and specify the date when you started the download. \n",
        "3. If you encoutner any issues, please raise an issue on [Github](https://github.com/tqiaowen/LSTrAP-Cloud) or contact us [here](mailto:qiaowen001@e.ntu.edu.sg)."
