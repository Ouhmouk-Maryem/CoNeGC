        "This script will help you stream RNA-seq data (FASTQ files) from ENA and quantify the RNA transcript abundance using kallisto concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What you will require\n",
        "1. A Google Account to save your data\n",
        "2. A folder in your Google Drive containing<br>\n",
        "  a) RunTable file<br>This file should contain the list of RunIDs that you want to download from ENA ([example]())<br>\n",

        "3. Download report<br>Summarises for each RunID the status of download, amount of data downloaded, amount of time taken for kallisto streaming and a statistics from kallisto\n",

        "### Bonus tips?\n",
        "1. If you noticed that the file has not been downloaded successfully (\"Download speed/time not accepted\"), not to worry, the script will attempt to download it again.\n",
        "2. Download got interrupted due to runtime disconnecting? Just re-run the script with 'Option B' (Step 1.2, part 5) and specify the date when you started the download. \n",
        "3. If you encoutner any issues, please raise an issue on [Github](https://github.com/tqiaowen/LSTrAP-Cloud) or contact us [here](mailto:qiaowen001@e.ntu.edu.sg)."
